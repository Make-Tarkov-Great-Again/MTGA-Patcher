## Who are we, and why are we doing this?

`Make Tarkov Great Again` (MTGA) was founded on the simple idea to do just that.

We felt that there shouldn't just be one option for emulation and began development on MTGA.

The server is being written in Go-lang compared to its JS/TS counter-part because, on top of its incredible performance,
it encourages rethinking why things were done the way they have been for so long.

We are developing this emulator to offer the best out-of-the-box experience for casuals and enthusiasts, a simple and
clean experience to not overwhelm you with anything but either playing or modifying your play experience.
